<h2>
  Honoring Our Contributors
</h2>

<p>
  As a young and relatively small alumni association, every single contribution received is an enormous help and tremendous push forward toward the ambitious goals that we set forth.
</p>

<p>
  We would like to honor and recognize alumni who made sizable contributions to the Alumni Association in 2017. The following individuals will have an Alumni Brick created in their behalf, which will be placed in front of the IRC on the infamous Alumni Brick Path. These individuals have made a contribution of more than 500 EUR to the Association and will have their legacy cemented on campus.

  Alumni, with your support- be it monetary, time support, expertise- we can achieve anything. The year 2017 was a record-breaking year in our history as an alumni association. We had the largest Homecoming in JU history, we awarded the Alumni Scholarship to another brilliant student in need, with our help JU achieved the largest and most alumni-integrated Career Fair, the Alumni Mentoring Program was relaunched, the new Alumni Database was launched—all of these wonderful accomplishments and more were achieved this year thanks to our great network!
