  Every year in fall Jacobs alumni from all over the world reunite at their alma mater. For the classes that celebrate their 5th or 10th anniversary, this is a very special weekend of the year. While there are many highlights such as the Gala Dinner or the Theme Party, simply getting together and seeing old faces as well as connecting with new alumni, is what makes this event so memorable every year.
</p>

<p>
  The event is organized by the Class Representatives of the anniversary classes in collaboration with the Assessor for Event Management of the Alumni Association and the Alumni Office of the university.
