  <p>
    This year we are launching a new redesigned Alumni Scholarship 2.0 – the<strong> Generation Fund</strong>, which has already been kicked off at the Homecoming dinner of Class of ‘04 and ‘09. Its key feature is <strong>self-sustainability</strong>.

  <p>
    While in the past donations have been given once and were “lost” forever afterwards, donations to the Generation Fund are investments in the education of bright Jacobs students who will – in return – prepare the ground for further generations to come. This concept sets up a new pioneering, future-oriented way of funding university studies that will have the potential to revolutionize the current system we all know at Jacobs.

    The design stage is ready, currently setting up the new structure. The Alumni Board together with the university are still working on the legal aspects of the fund. Nonetheless, all money donated to this cause will go towards the students, in the new set up or alternative ones. Until ready – we will keep fundraising!
