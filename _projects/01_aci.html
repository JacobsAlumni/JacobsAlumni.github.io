  The ACI is one of our most successful projects with a focus on consultancy advice around its ongoing change process. After successful engagements around Student Marketing and Tuition Financing in 2014, the ACI has established itself as a ‘trusted adviser’ to the university leadership. Currently, further involvement in the areas of Financial Literacy, Pricing and Employability are being investigated. Find out more about the ACI and their work <a href="/alumni-projects/alumni-consulting-initiative">here</a> and get in touch with Henrik or Axel if you want to become part of the team!
