  This year we are launching a new redesigned Alumni Scholarship 2.0 – the <a href="/alumni-projects/generation-fund">Generation Fund</a>, which has already been kicked off at the Homecoming dinner of Class of ‘04 and ‘09. Its key feature will be <strong>self-sustainability</strong>. While in the past donations have been given once and were “lost” forever afterwards, donations to the Generation Fund are investments in the education of bright Jacobs students who will – in return – prepare the ground for further generations to come. This concept sets up a new pioneering, future-oriented way of funding university studies that will have the potential to revolutionize the current system we all know at Jacobs.
