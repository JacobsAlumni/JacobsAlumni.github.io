  (UPCOMING PROJECT) Next year we are planning to launch a new Alumni Mentorship program, that will foster relationships between students and alumni. It will be a unique opportunity for everyone to form meaningful relationships, network and get insights regarding career paths, personal development and general guidance for the early start in the professional life. Stay tuned for more information!
