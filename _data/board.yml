    Anne (’13) is currently working as a strategy consultant in Munich. After graduating from Jacobs with a BA in Global Economics and Management, she continued to do her Master’s at WHU Otto Beisheim School of Management. At Jacobs, she was involved in founding JSC, rowing, and organizing the graduation ball. She believes that the Jacobs spirit of living together in an internationally diverse community does not stop with graduation, but that the Jacobs Alumni Association can offer you part of your home away from home anywhere in the world! Her favorite “Jacobs moment” was when she met a current Kruppie at a streetfood stand in Shanghai.
